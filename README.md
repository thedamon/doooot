# doooot

doooot is a simple app that tries to keep you on track by periodically reminding you what you should be working on

#Stack
 - electron.js
 - React
 - ES6
 - Storage unknown

#Roadmap

##0.1

 - Always-in-front window.
 - Single task text input
 - Complete and Snooze buttons
 - Snoozed task

##0.2
 - relegate to topbar or equivalent
 - more beautiful animations
 - settings (snooze duration)
 - maintain list of tasks so when you complete one the next one becomes active

##Possible Futures
 - associate tasks with software (won't bother you if x software is focused or will bother more if you leave it for an extended period of time)
 - read in tasks from 3rd party services (wunderlist list, google, apple, etc)
